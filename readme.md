## Requirements
Any version of Python 3


## Discription
This program uses Bellmanford algorithm as routing mechanism to simulate network distances from each other.


## Usage

### Initiation

To run:

`python main.py`

You're asked to enter network size. i.e. `5`

<!-- ### As Client

`python client.py`

After running the client, you can send calculation requests in the following format:

* Add
* Subtract
* Divide
* Multiply

And,

`$ Sin $ 6 $`

* Tan
* Sin
* Cot
* Cos

Result will be returned in the following format:

`$ Time $ Result $`

which:
* **Time** is the exec. time
* **Result** is the result of calcuation -->
